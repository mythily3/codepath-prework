## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
A challenge was to add an IBAction for the first time. 

My favorite Applications:
1. imesssage
    Can send silly stickers to send to people
    Can create groupchats to communicate with all your friends at once
2. spotify
    Can follow your friends to see what everyone is listening to 
    Makes playlists for you depending on your music taste
3. instagram
    Can add highlights of your stories on your instagram page.
    Can like and comment on people's pictures

An app idea is to connect students with college/high school students who would tutor them. I've noticed with my peers, that when students need a tutor, it is often hard for them to find them, and they end up emailing teachers (who don't have time to tutor), their parents post in parent groupchats, or they find high school/college tutors through connections. Overall, there is no formal way to connect high school/college tutors (not working for a tutoring company) with young students. The app would provide a platform for tutors to post that they are available to tutor, what subjects they specialize in, what high shool/middle school they attended (so people from the same schools can be connected), their pay rate, and their availability. That way when parents are finding tutors for their children, or a student is finding one for themself, they can easily search and apply a filter to find the perfect tutor for their child, and college/high school students can work a part-time job.
